#   - The no serfdom Production Method for subsistence farms 
#   - Typo in the third tier of the Rice Farm Production Method; it should cost 20 fertilizer instead of 30 fertilizer, because 2 * 10 = 20
#   - Amount of gold gained from using the Nitroglycerin Production Method reduced from 5 down to 2.5, as the Nitroglycerin Production Method should give half of the gold output from the Dynamite Production Method
#   - Collectivized Agriculture doesn't have its own peasantry PM. This means if you get Collectivized Agriculture straight from Serfdom, your peasants will erroneously stay as serfs. Changed so they use the "Homesteading" PM. This means when combined with the fact that the farms will be fully self-owned now, there will be professional farmers (instead of peasants) there to own it. It also means they produce more grain to compensate for the fact less people are getting subsistence output
#   - Capitalists in canals were starving. They are now replaced with bureaucrats
